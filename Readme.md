# Project Title

## Description

In this project, the goal is to test the provided implementation (source code) of the VendingMachine class. To test the VendingMachine class, you are supposed to implement a testing environment that should contain a test driver to execute test cases on the VendingMachine object(s). 
## Getting Started

## Dependencies

- A modern C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC)
- Make (optional, if you are using a Makefile to build your project)

## Installing and Running

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the project.
3. Compile the code:
    - If you're using a Makefile, simply run `make`.
    - If you're not using a Makefile, run `g++ -o main main.cpp` to compile your program.
4. Run the compiled program using `./main` (on Unix systems) or `main.exe` (on Windows).

## Running Tests

1. Once, the `main.exe` file is executed, all the test cases are automaticaly executed.
2. The `TS.txt` file contains the test cases. Each test case specifies the functions that will be executed.
3. To write additional test cases make changes to the `TS.txt` file. Follow the formate in the `TS.txt` file.
